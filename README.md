# AIComp - Artificial Intelligent Agent for Programming Logic and Learning Assistant ðŸ¤“ (gradio version)

AIComp is a programming logic and learning assistant (an AI agent) developed at the Institute of Computing (IComp) of the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM). This AI is designed to assist users with questions about programming, particularly in Python and C, using a Gradio interface.

## Features

- **Programming Assistance**: AIComp can provide guidance and answers to questions related to programming, specifically focused on Python and C.
- **Experimental Technology**: This AI is based on LangChain and OpenAI API models, making it an educational experiment to explore the use of large language models (LLM) in assisting with code and computing concepts.

## How to Use

1. Download the file AIComp.py
2. Create a '.env' file with your OpenAI API key
3. Execute: $ python3 AIComp.py
4. Open a browser on the link http://127.0.0.1:7860/
